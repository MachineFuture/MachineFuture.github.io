              <p>Full text Lounge Rules<br>
What to post?</p>
<p>&quot;Your most truthfully interesting self.&quot;</p>
<p>This is not the same as</p>
<p>&quot;Your most depressed self&quot; or &quot;your most angry self.&quot; Nor &quot;most made-up interesting self.&quot;</p>
<p>Lounge Rules</p>
<ol>
<li>Be civil, polite and courteous<br>
Unclassy behavior is not allowed and is too vast to list here. This can include subreddit drama and bait posts that lead into a heated discussion. This sub has a global audience and some topics are better suited for other subreddits. This includes no NSFW content, NO POLITICS, no glurge 'you are loved, important, necessary, inspirational, motivational', Lonely Hearts, romance troubles posts.</li>
</ol>
<p>All posts and comments that contain profanity will be removed, regardless of context. This includes vulgar content of all kinds. If the Queen wouldn't be caught saying it, we shouldn't either. This is high society. Conduct yourself accordingly.</p>
<p>Because it is really easy to break this rule with an image, images are also discouraged.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do not beg for awards or ask for/offer upvotes<br>
Please report posts that are purely award begging ('My premium is expiring!'), sponging, scrounging or mooching. Such behavior is quite unbecoming. Posts and comments referencing or inquiring about awards or the upper-lounges are often thinly-veiled begging, and are also not allowed regardless of context.</li>
</ol>
<p>Re-posting someone else's OC for sympathy or awards is strictly forbidden and if caught will result in a permanent ban from Lounge.</p>
<p>The only allowed exception for award-digging is found during our Saturday Charity Work.</p>
<p>Asking for upvotes, or offering upvotes is against our mother Queen's strict matriarchal rules of reddit.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>No first day posts/introduction posts/last day in Lounge posts/farewell posts/How I got my award posts outside of their appropriate post .<br>
The Lounge holds Friday Farewell Parties and Monday New Member Mixers; such content shall be confined to these threads. How I received Premium/I have Premium posts are also more appropriate in the New Member Mixers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hi, hello, Just wanted to say hi, and such are really just low effort introductions and belong in the New Member Mixer. If you really want to say Hi, Hello have a nice day to someone, do it in the New Member Mixer. The new arrivals will love it.</p>
<p>Because it is really easy to break this rule with an image, images are also discouraged.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>No giveaways, self-promotion or solicitations are permitted outside of the Weekly charity thread<br>
Self-promotion, giveaways or donation requests are only allowed in the Saturday Charity post.</li>
</ol>
<p>4b. Weekly Posts<br>
*Please familiarize yourself with our Weekly Posts.</p>
<p>Sunday: Subreddit Sharing. Share and post subreddits for others to visit in this thread.<br>
Monday: New Member Mixer. ALL New arrivals are required to announce their arrival in this thread and nowhere else in Lounge. This even includes those who have returned to Lounge after a previous visit.<br>
Tuesday: Talk About Awards. All mentions of awards, coins, premium benefits go in this thread. The place to ask questions about the awards or give opinions about the awards. Please follow the threads rules.<br>
Wednesday: Weekly Wellness Check. Let everyone know how that diet is coming along or not. Fill us in on what's ailing or healing you.<br>
Thursday: Lounge Business Meeting. Discuss Lounge related business here in this thread. Questions about lounge answered. Suggestions about Lounge considered. Complaints about Lounge handled. Lounge Praise and Lounge Thanks also go here.<br>
Friday: The Lounge Farewell Party. Every Friday we start a new farewell party for those members of our exclusive club whose membership is expiring. This is where one goes to say goodbye to the Lounge and we encourage those staying to go wish them a bon voyage and happy travels in the wilds of Reddit.<br>
Saturday: The Charity/Giveaways/Promotional thread. Promote your favorite charity and possibly earn it some donations. Try to extend your stay in Lounge in a giveaway. One could just ask to have their stay extended. It feels so much better when earned. Promote your Youtube, blog or invention here.<br>
These threads re-new every week, hence weekly, you may post in the current one or wait for a new one. If your submission fits one of the above categories it belongs in that thread. All out of place items will be removed</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Please respect the privacy of what is shared in r/lounge.<br>
Always exercise caution with what you decide to put on the internet, however please show class and respect by keeping what is shared in r/lounge in r/lounge. Please do not post screenshots elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
